      "message": "Using this property would be quite redundant readability wise: `lifecycle.lifecycleScope`, the word lifecycle is repeated.\nAlso, it may be unclear that we\u0027re talking about a `CoroutineScope` if user code has symbols or types that include the word `scope` but are not related to coroutines.\n\nConsequently, I suggest to rename this as `coroutineScope`, so usage would look so instead: `lifecycle.coroutineScope`.\n\nAnother possibility is calling it `mainScope` since it dispatches on the main thread, and the naming would align with `MainScope()` which is already present in kotlinx.coroutines.",

      "message": "I find this method confusing. Given the use case, which is running some code when the lifecycle state is at least the state that has been passed as parameter, being a both a suspend function and taking a lambda that is run before resuming is IMHO highly likely to cause confusion.\nIn addition, being top level for this would pollute autocompletion for all the places where you don\u0027t have and don\u0027t need a lifecycle.\n\nI suggest the following replacement: an extension function for Lifecycle (and Lifecycle only, no LifecycleOwner shortcut) named `awaitState`.\nThe signature would be `suspend fun Lifecycle.awaitState(state: Lifecycle.State)`. With such a replacement, there\u0027s no ambiguity, it will resume when the state has been reached.
