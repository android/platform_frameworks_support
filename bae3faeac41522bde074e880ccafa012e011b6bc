      "message": "On further reflection, the whole withXXXX concept seems to be weird. First of all this function _suspend_ until some condition is true, yet it is named withXxx and takes a block. So I can write:\n\n```\nwithCreated(lc) { \n   // this get called when the condition is reached (1)\n}\n// this _also_ get called when the condition is reached after (1) finishes.\n```\n\nSo, what is actually the purpose of the block and why it is called withXxx? It looks, by looking at what is does, this function should be named `awaitCreated(lc)`, but still the purpose of having a block parameter is escaping me.",

      "message": "Calling an external block from inside the callback does not seems like a good idea. `suspendCoroutine` functions are designed for integration with callbacks and are supposed to quickly resume the corresponding coroutine. You can put all the other code (like `block()`) invocation _after_ the `suspendCoroutine` invocation, so it gets invoked in a coroutine (with an appropriate context) after its resumption. This also automatically makes it possible to make the corresponding block a suspending function.",
