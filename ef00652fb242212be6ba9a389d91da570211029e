      "message": "I don\u0027t really like this abstraction, but it seems good enough for now. Please, if you have suggestions around how to make this logic more friendly -- I will be happy.\n\nThe other ideas I\u0027ve tried: \n1. split it to Adjuster and Flinger. Seems to verbose and I still need to make sure one knows around the other. Also Flinger is not really needed to anchored logic.\n2. Split AnimatedDraggable to AnchoredAnimatedDraggable and just AnimatedDraggable. \nSeems like they share a lot in common, but it\u0027s still a potentially nice option, but it will be a little bit harder to discover.\n\nFeel free to write your suggestion as well.",
