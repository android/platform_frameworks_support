We generally avoid using iterators if we can, but maybe there isn\u0027t a better solution here.\n\nQasid:\nEach time layout happens, what is the better solution you are thinking of?\n\nPhil:\nI was thinking to do something like iterating over a list without creating an interator. It may be faster to hold everything in an ArrayList and do the (for i \u003d 0; i \u003c list.size; i++) list.get(i) thing. That avoids allocating an iterator.\n\nMy concern is that layout is pretty time-critical, since everything is traversed and it needs still to fit into one frame time.\n\nI\u0027m OK to submit this as-is, but you may want to think a bit more about it. And if someone discovers that using panes leads to jank, they\u0027ll be talking to you :-)\n\nQasid:\nAs you suggested, let\u0027s see what Alan thinks",
