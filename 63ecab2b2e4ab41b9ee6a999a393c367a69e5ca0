      "message": "Hmm... It doesn\u0027t feel quite right having this map of views passed into the open helper and the sync view method, it doesn\u0027t feel like the helper\u0027s responsibility to sync views or know about them.\n\nI suggest moving the `syncViews` function to the RoomOpenHelper#Delegate interface and have the delegate implementation generated by the SQLiteOpenHelperWriter. That way there wouldn\u0027t be a need to pass the views map as a constructor argument. It is also OK to move the actual syncViews impl to a util function that takes the map and the map is code generated by the writter but then calls the runtime util function.",
