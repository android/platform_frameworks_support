      "message": "I sort of feel like the -noui or -noappcompat implies that it\u0027s a variant of the slice-core which isn\u0027t quite true? But maybe that\u0027s ok?\n\nThe API diff of these is that slice-core-manager basically has everything the SliceManager needs; slice-core depends on slice-core-manager and has SliceProvider in it.\n\n\nAlan, do you have thoughts on this / are there any guidelines around module naming?",
