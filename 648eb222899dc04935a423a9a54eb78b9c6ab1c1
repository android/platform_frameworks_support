      "message": "I sort of feel like the -noui or -noappcompat implies that it\u0027s a variant of the slice-core which isn\u0027t quite true? But maybe that\u0027s ok?\n\nThe API diff of these is that slice-core-manager basically has everything the SliceManager needs; slice-core depends on slice-core-manager and has SliceProvider in it.\n\n\nAlan, do you have thoughts on this / are there any guidelines around module naming?",

      "message": "Sub-feature names should reflect hierarchy and purpose.\n\nSo typically you\u0027d see primary-secondary where \"secondary\" is an optional feature that depends on \"primary\" and provides new functionality described concisely as \"secondary\".\n\nWe also have the inverse, where \"primary\" is composed of several smaller sub-features that may be used independently. This is how we\u0027ve handled breaking up libraries like compat that are too large. This strategy applies here, where slices-core-manager is a sub-feature that can be used independently of the slices-core feature and only provides \"manager\" functionality.\n\n\"noappcompat\" doesn\u0027t describe a feature. That\u0027s describing the absence of a dependency.",
