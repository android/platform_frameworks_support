Maybe we should expose instead something like: \n\nPrePopulatedDBOpenHelper.createFromAsset(..., delegate)?\n\nAs well I think it is better to separate asset and file codepathes, it looks cleaner than having bool param in this case. Check if from reader point of view: createFromFile(\"path\", true) what does this \"true\" mean, a reader has to go and read the createFromFile docs. In \n\"createFromAsset\" case, there is no mysterious bool and it is obvious what is going on.",
