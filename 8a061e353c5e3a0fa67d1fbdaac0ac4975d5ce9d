      "message": "The new prebuilt includes an ExoPlayer change that improves timestamp/byte offset calculation in constant bitrate MP3s (see also [internal: b/120390268]). Unfortunately the test streams don\u0027t have consistent frame sizes, and this leads to the duration calculations using the new logic being slightly wrong, so I need to increase these tolerances. I don\u0027t expect this to lead to any user-visible issues.",
