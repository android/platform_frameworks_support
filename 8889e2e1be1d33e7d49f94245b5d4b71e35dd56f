      "message": "What we want to do is escape any regex special characters in the URL (such as the plus symbol, question marks, etc) but *not* escape any specific instances of .* which must be treated as wildcards.\n\nPattern.quote() adds \\Q and \\E around the string to make everything within that a literal expression (i.e., escape everything). This replace operation just un-escapes the one other regex case we support.\n\nAdded a test that has a .* before an {argName} block to exercise this particular line of code (the existing tests such as deepLinkWildcardMatch and deepLinkMultipleMatch test the similar lines after the while loop).",
