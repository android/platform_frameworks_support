Maybe it isn\u0027t a huge deal, but it looks like it is walking each of the child fragments and checking if it should call \"onPrimaryNavigationFragmentChanged()\" when we know that none of them need to do that. The only time it would do that is if you\u0027re going from parent to child and it would be covered by the next call in setPrimaryNavigationFragment().\n\nNo problems with function, though.",
