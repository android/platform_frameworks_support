Maybe it isn\u0027t a huge deal, but it looks like it is walking each of the child fragments and checking if it should call \"onPrimaryNavigationFragmentChanged()\" when we know that none of them need to do that. The only time it would do that is if you\u0027re going from parent to child and it would be covered by the next call in setPrimaryNavigationFragment().\n\nNo problems with function, though.",

      "message": "setPrimaryNavigationFragment() can result in transitive calls to onPrimaryNavigationFragmentChanged() all the way down the Fragment hierarchy since to be a primary navigation fragment, you *and all your parent fragments* must be the primary navigation fragment for their respective FragmentManagers.

I\u0027ll evaluate that for a future CL.",
