      "message": "When I run `buildEnvironment` I see the jacoco dependency we specify on the classpath. Prior to this (when I had removed it), jacoco wasn\u0027t on the classpath at all. While the things we compile in `buildSrc/` end up on the classpath, I\u0027m pretty sure the way that it works is that they\u0027re compiled on their own and then its output + its dependencies are loaded onto the regular buildscript classpath. So anything we define here is available during compilation of `buildSrc` sources and will end up on the buildscript because they become transitive dependencies of the `buildSrc` output, we can still affect the buildscript classpath with normal dependencies.",
