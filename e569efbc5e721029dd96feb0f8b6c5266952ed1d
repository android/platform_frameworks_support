      "message": "I saw that one, and a few other Serial / Sequential Executors in G3. That one is cool but doesn\u0027t stop due to runtime exceptions, they are swallowed and logged which is not quite what we want. If there is one flaw of this simple TransactionExecutor that is exposed by those tests is that it doesn\u0027t immediately consider if the task will get Rejected or not, but we are not wrapping ExecutorServices so one can argue that we shouldn\u0027t do any special handling of that case, i.e. it is just another RuntimeException.",
