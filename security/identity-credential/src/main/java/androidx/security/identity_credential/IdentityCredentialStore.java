/**
 * An interface to a secure store for user identity documents.
 *
 * <p>This interface is deliberately fairly general and abstract.  To the extent possible,
 * specification of the message formats and semantics of communication with credential
 * verification devices and issuing authorities (IAs) is out of scope. It provides the
 * interface with secure storage but a credential-specific Android application will be
 * required to implement the presentation and verification protocols and processes
 * appropriate for the specific credential type.
 *
 * <p>TODO: mention various backends, e.g. software emulation vs. calling into credstore/IC HAL if on R.</p>
 *
 * <p>Multiple credentials can be created.  Each credential comprises:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A document type, which is a string.</li>
 *
 *     <li>A set of namespaces, which serve to disambiguate value names. It is recommended
 *     that namespaces be structured as reverse domain names so that IANA effectively serves
 *     as the namespace registrar.</li>
 *
 *     <li>For each namespace, a set of name/value pairs, each with an associated set of
 *     access control profile IDs.  Names are and values are typed and are either signed
 *     integers, booleans, UTF-8 strings or bytestrings.</li>
 *
 *     <li>A set of access control profiles, each with a profile ID and a specification
 *     of the conditions which satisfy the profile's requirements.</li>
 *
 *     <li>An asymmetric key pair which is used to authenticate the credential to the IA,
 *     called the <em>CredentialKey</em>.</li>
 *
 *     <li>A set of zero or more named reader authentication public keys, which are used to authenticate
 *   an authorized reader to the credential.</li>
 *
 *     <li>A set of named signing keys, which are used to sign collections of values and session
 *   transcripts.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>TODO:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Sort out exceptions, in particular specify in Javadoc the circumstances
 *     under which an exception is thrown.</li>
 *
 *     <li>We might be leaking Keystore keys because we lack atomicity in deletion of
 *     Keystore keys and persisting CBOR. Therefore, have a way to enumerate created
 *     credentials (by virtue of CBOR files all living in the same directory), the keystore
 *     keys they use, and use this to delete all unused Keystore keys.</li>
 * </ul>
