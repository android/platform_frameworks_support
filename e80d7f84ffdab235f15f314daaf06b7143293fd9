(It could make sense to me to include the word \"snapshot\" in a comment if we still want to have it somewhere)",

I guess that if we set this for the normal postsubmit builds and not for the release builds then it should be unambiguous.\n\nI guess that it would be slightly more correct to have the value default be true rather than false though so that developer builds are considered to be SNAPSHOT versions too, although that might be more surprising and therefore more annoying.",
