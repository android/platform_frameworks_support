      "message": "In the comments for onParamsChanged, it indicates that the parameters that are modified would not cause a re-recording of the repaint boundary, however, it looks like ownerView here is being invalidated which would end up causing a displaylist to be recreated. Should we cache the results for onParamsChanged and conditionally invalidate the ownerView if necessary?",

      "message": "we are not rerecording this renderNode. onwerView is AndroidCraneView, and we need to invalidate it, so the renderNode would be redrawn with new params applied. no renderNode.beginRecording() would be called, as this renderNode wasn\u0027t marked as dirty. \nthere is no need for adding some conditional invalidation for ownerView here I guess, as if something called onParamsChange it means at least something has been changed, as we call this only when the param really has been changed on the ComponentNode class side, like this:\n        set(value) {\n            if (field !\u003d value) {\n                field \u003d value\n                owner?.onRepaintBoundaryParamsChange(this)\n            }\n        }",
