Technically the item is *eligible* for selection, but may not be selectable at runtime because of other factors, like the lib is configured w/ SelectionPredicates#createSelectSingleAnything(), or configured w/ a custom SelectionPredicate with zany rules defined by developer :)\n\nUltimately I should audit the cases where this method is being used by developers to see how and why it is being used. I don\u0027t recall the use case.",
