      "message": "kchyn@google.com: I recognize that this conditional branching is pretty similar to what I had done previously with BiometricPromptDemoController before making the methods abstract instead. I could still do that here if you think it makes sense, but I was trying to avoid complicating the API with two concrete BiometricPrompt classes, with the only difference being that one is for a FragmentActivity and one is for a Fragment.\n\nMaybe if I went that route, I could provide factory constructors for the concrete implementations which would be accessed through this class? Curious to hear your thoughts on this.",

I left it as-is for consistency with the existing constructor, but should we maybe consider reordering these?",
