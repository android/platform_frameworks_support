      "message": "If the controller2 gets the allowed commands from PlaybackStateCompat.CustomAction, I guess that the controller2 users can call MediaController2.sendCustomCommand() with those commands, which will eventually call MediaControllerCompat.sendCustomCommand() (As seen in L589).\n\nHowever, actually the PlaybackStateCompat.CustomAction is expected to be sent through MediaControllerCompat.TransportControls.sendCustomAction(), not sendCustomCommand. Therefore the session may not be prepared for those custom actions in onCustomCommand().\n\nI think we need to distinguish the two:\n1) \u0027Real\u0027 custom commands -\u003e Should be sent through MediaControllerCompat.sendCommand()\n2) Custom commands made from PlaybackState.CustomAction -\u003e MediaControllerCompat.TransportControls.sendCustomAction()",
