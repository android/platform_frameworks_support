I would think that having a separate list of artifacts here (instead of linking to a .zip and listing exclusions (are these libraries not all found in one .zip?)) would make it easier to accidentally miss some artifacts, although I guess we can tell based on the diff in this patch that no libraries are forgotten. So, I guess this seems fine to me?",

Missing something is (as you have said) covered by looking into the diffs. I know it\u0027s not ideal to manually make such a list, but I don\u0027t know about a better source ...",
