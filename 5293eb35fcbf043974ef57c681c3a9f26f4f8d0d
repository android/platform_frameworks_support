I would think that having a separate list of artifacts here (instead of linking to a .zip and listing exclusions (are these libraries not all found in one .zip?)) would make it easier to accidentally miss some artifacts, although I guess we can tell based on the diff in this patch that no libraries are forgotten. So, I guess this seems fine to me?",
