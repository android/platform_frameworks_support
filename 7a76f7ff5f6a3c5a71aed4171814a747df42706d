      "message": "Ignoring the super call is still totally a valid thing to do. Just like in the test Fragments I updated, the primary pattern is to add @InflatesRes and remove your onCreateView() override entirely, moving any work you were doing on the inflated View to onViewCreated as per the new Javadoc on this method.\n\nWere you suggesting skipping onCreateView() if you had an @InflatesRes? That would certainly enforce that the annotation is not added then ignored.",

      "message": "Yeah, onViewCreated is sufficient callback. My fear is that when callback is \"optional\" it is immediately complicates understanding of an api. So @InflateRes annotation doesn\u0027t immediately associate with onCreateView, so I as a dev adding this annotation wouldn\u0027t see any consequences for onCreateView. Maybe if @InflateRes is named @onCreateView, then I associate it, but I don\u0027t think that @onCreateView is a good name. That\u0027s said, I\u0027d go with the current onCreateView implementation, but if you and George feel strongly otherwise, I wouldn\u0027t mind.",
