But please review the test-as-is, since I don\u0027t think this requires a test change.\n\nAlso: I observed on one of my devices that the test crashes because we never call onLoadResource(). I\u0027m not sure if my device is in a funky state, or if something else is broken in the APK--either way, I\u0027ll try to investigate.",
