      "message": "This will be a problem if the vendor library doesn\u0027t exist on device. What will happen is that if this call gets made then it will try to classload ExtenderVersioning, which doesn\u0027t exist which will cause a ClassNotFoundException. That is the reason why the the BokehImageCaptureExtender class is designed the way it is.\nThe interface that is defined in the vendor lib is wrapped in the Vendor extender class which extends a different interface.",
