      "message": "One reason we may want to use a different name is that this reserves a pretty common \"Border\" name for something that doesn\u0027t feel as necessary. For example, I can imagine having a composable function:\n\n@Composable\nfun Border(stroke: Stroke, strokeThickness: Dp, shape: Shape) {\n...\n}\n\nPerhaps this class is important enough to give it such a primary name? I\u0027ll let it go for now, but I reserve the right to ask for a rename later when we go over all of our needs :-)",
