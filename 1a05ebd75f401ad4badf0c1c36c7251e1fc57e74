      "message": "It appears to me that the bug is two-fold:\n\nGiven a library (in this case, the pom file of a library) that does not need to be jetified,\n  (1) Jetifier should ideally not jetify it;\n  (2) It\u0027s still okay for Jetifier to jetify it, but it must return an output identical to the input.\n\nThis CL fixes (1), but I don\u0027t see it fixes (2) yet. We may argue that if (1) is guaranteed, (2) will no longer be relevant, but I think it\u0027s better that we fix both to prevent future bugs. WDYT?",

      "message": "2) is really hard to achieve (even from engineering resources perspective - XML, POM, ProGuard, Java files all have special parsers). Sometimes we rely on regEx and not on full spec grammar. And mostly even if we achieve it, recreating a zip file would break security signatures anyway (different order of the files, timestamps, version of library used to produce it, etc.). I understand it would be nice to have 2) but 1) does the same job and is something we can afford at this moment.",
