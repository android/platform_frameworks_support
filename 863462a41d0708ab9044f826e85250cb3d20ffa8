      "message": "I assumed it is better to crash so presubmit would fail on tests if we accidentally use this method from the API version where it is not supported. I thought it is better to discover the mistake as as soon as possible instead of providing a solution where shadows will be correctly drawn on all API versions except one. For sure if this method would be a part of the public api I would prefer to not crash, but for the internal logic the correctness is more important I think. \nIf you don\u0027t agree I would be happy to remove this.
