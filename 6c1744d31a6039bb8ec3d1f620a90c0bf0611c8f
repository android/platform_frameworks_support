I could be wrong though, it\u0027s a good candidate for a nice philosophical discussion on a late Sunday afternoon with a glass of whiskey on a porch.\n\nDoesn\u0027t matter that much for test code though, and taking the +2 into account, I think it\u0027s OK to mark this as resolved regardless, right? I can follow-up with another CL if needed :)",
