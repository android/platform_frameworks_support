If your description of the problem is correct, then this should fail the second time the captureCallback is called for 2 reasons. First, you are saying that onCaptureCompleted() should have a maximum of 1 interaction, but that\u0027s not the case if it is called again due to the preview CaptureRequest. Second, you\u0027re saying that the CaptureRequest argument must have intent STILL_CAPTURE, but that won\u0027t be the case for preview captures either.",
