Right? If that\u0027s true, I think that means we want this to prompt the user inline rather than recommend the command-line argument.\n\nI think that can be done via:\n\necho \"Do you accept the license agreement? [y/n]\"\nread acceptsLicenseAgreement\nif [ \"${acceptsLicenseAgreement}\" \u003d\u003d \"y\" ]; then\n  touch \"${licenseAcceptedPath}\"\nelse\n  exit 1\nfi",
