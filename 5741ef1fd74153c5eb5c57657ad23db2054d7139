Current idea is to inject agent in runtime, so you have to:\nOption A: have a separate classloader with your own version: that will lead to the whole bunch of issue when same class comes from different classloaders. \nOption B: Somehow detect a library in the app and hope it is good enough...\n\nSo I wanted to start with keeping dependencies as slim as possible: you can use only transient dependencies from a library you inspect.",
