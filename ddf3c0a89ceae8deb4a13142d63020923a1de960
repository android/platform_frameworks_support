      "message": "This might be a good opportunity to move the buildCaptureRequest() method into the camera2 impl package.\n\nThat way you can convert from the generic CaptureConfig into the CaptureRequest builder that is required for making camera2 calls.\n\nIn addition, the CaptureConfig class shouldn\u0027t need to know about the mapping of configured Surfaces. With this change CaptureConfig has an indirect dependency on the details of the camera2 impl.",
