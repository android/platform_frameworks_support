I would\u0027ve assumed that if a groupId was present that it would be the full groupId, so in this case \"androidx.arch.core\".\n\nI wouldn\u0027t consider it necessary to add the \"androidx.\" to the groupId before submitting this change (I think that will require add_release_commit_tags.sh) but I would recommend it eventually",

      "message": "There are a couple arch comp libraries like lifecycle (13 artifactIds), navigation (10 artifactIds), arch.core (3 artifactIds), and room (9 artifactIds) that have many artifactIds, but the they all keep the same version.  Does it make sense to make a bunch of individual tags for each artifactId?  Does that not seem superfluous?",
