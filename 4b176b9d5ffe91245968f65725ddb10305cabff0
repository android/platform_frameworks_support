      "message": "previously, Clara and I suggested to add tests. \nThere tests run only after M (not sure if the feature is available only after M). \nconsidering the amount of the code in here, the 10ish tests is far from being enough.",

      "message": "I think judging the effectiveness of a test suite by the number of test methods is not the right way to think about testing. Can you please be more explicit about the tests you\u0027d like to see here?\nThis is largely a port of code that has been running in the framework for years and the class is not even public API.\n\nThis is blocking ongoing work and as I mentioned in the cl message, there are current plans to change this UI which might mean all the work could effectively be trashed.",
