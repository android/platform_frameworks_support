      "message": "this is a possible solution but I\u0027m not sure it is the right thing to recommend because `!isActive` does not mean the lifecycle is destroyed, it might just mean some sub coroutine call cancelled our coroutine job.\nalso, this check could be `lifecycle.state \u003e\u003d STARTED` (no coroutine) and it would be more clear.\n\ni really like this dispatcher API for the happy paths but for handling errors etc, not sure how i feel about it ðŸ˜•",

      "message": "I talked with Tor, he mentioned that it will be easy to provide a lint check.\nSo i think that can more or less fix this concern.\n\n@Roman, do you think if there should be a more generic link check which flags catching Cancellation exception implicitly inside coroutines ? \n\nFor this use case, This is the rule i\u0027m thinking about:\n\nLook for catch statements inside the whenStarted\u0027s argument block. If they catch any cancelation exception, look for `if(lifecycle.currentState \u003e\u003d STARTED)` or `isActive` checks for UI/navigation access.\nSame for finally blocks.",
