      "message": "Is lock-freedom really needed here for coroutine scope creating? It involves a lot of boilerplate code. The code of `register` seems innocent enough (it immediately fires of a new coroutine), so I\u0027d suggest to consider changing the definition of `Lifecycle.mInternalScopeRef` to:\n\ninternal val mInternalScope by lazy { createLifecycleCoroutineScope() }\n\nwhere\n\ninternal fun Lifecycle.createLifecycleCoroutineScope() \u003d \n    LifecycleCoroutineScope(this, SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Main)\n    .apply { register() } \n\nso then you can say \n\nval Lifecycle.coroutineScope: CoroutineScope\n    get() \u003d mInternalScope\n\n(Or just make a val on Lifecycle public instead of extension)",
