      "message": "I thought about this sentence some more and I think I figured out what still seems odd about it to me.\n\nWhen the beginning of the sentence says \"Release androidx.$groupIdWithoutAndroidx:$artifactId:$version\", is it saying that the git tag itself is the release?\nWhen the end of the sentence says \"released on $date.\", is it saying that there\u0027s some other process (probably pushing to the Maven repository) that is the release?\n\nIf those are both true, then it seems to me to be somewhat confusing/distracting to use the word \"release\" twice in the same sentence to refer to two different processes.\n\nHow would we feel about \"Release androidx.$groupIdWithoutAndroidx:$artifactId:$version on $date.\"?",
