      "message": "In a chat, John Reck pointed out that at api 21, shadows are drawn with a new api (this code reflects that fact) and at api 28, shadows could be colored.  I think it would be a real weird addition to allow coloring of shadows pre 21 given that there would be a gap between 21 and 28 where shadow coloring would still not work.\n\nLet\u0027s not do the shadow coloring (remove both fill shadow and key shadow stuff).",

I\u0027ve gone back and forth about this over time and am currently in the camp that code that is intended to only be called in one place, should just be written inline in that one place.

SwipeToRefreshLayout is actually a layout, like LinearLayout or RelativeLayout, and if you were to set a background color on it, I think users would assume that it would actually set a background of the layout itself.  (In fact, it probably already does change it\u0027s background color with android:background (or something like that)).\n\nThat being said, I think this attribute should likely be called something like refreshIndicatorBackgroundColor.",
