      "message": "That\u0027s interesting. I suppose that the fact that this is a SNAPSHOT in the Maven sense is a property of the fact that the url that developers will be using will be some arbitrary build number.\n\nTechnically I think a few of these builds would also be the actual official builds too.\n\nI\u0027ve also seen the term \u0027repo\u0027 used to refer to a (non-packed) maven repository, although I guess that because the actual artifacts inside the repo claim (incorrectly) to already have the correct release versions, it could confuse developers.\n\nTheoretically, someone could publish a library that depends on one of these artifacts in a \"snapshot\" directory, but the dependency version in their published library would still look like it refers to a release version.\n\nHow would we feel about first implementing the ability for projects in AndroidX to have non-release versions (probably ending in \"-dev\")? Do we have an idea of who\u0027s asking about this and what their preference is?",
