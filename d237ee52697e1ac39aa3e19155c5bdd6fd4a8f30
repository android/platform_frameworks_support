      "message": "Is it worth exposing that level of detail in the output? I think broadly, most folks want to know how many runs contribute to min/max/mean.  (Stddev is another matter, where we\u0027re currently not reporting stddev of individual loop iterations, but thats separate)\n\nIf we do expose the two types of looping, I\u0027m not sure of what names would clarify meaning - iteration, count, runs all seem ambiguous.",

      "message": "min/max/mean all only operate at the repeat count level, the number reported by count\u003d doesn\u0027t really map to that. We exclusively report mean for mMaxIteration, it\u0027s only for REPEAT_COUNT that we report a min/max/mean. I would think just mMaxIteration is the number you\u0027d want, then, as we only work on averages of mMaxIteration?",
