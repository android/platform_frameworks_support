      "message": "I would like to avoid this WeakHashMap here. It might be better to have the child compositions tell the parent when they have `hasPendingFrame` changes. The parent can then maintain a list of children with pending frames. The root context is idle if `hasPendingFrame` is false and the child list is empty.\n\nAlso there would be no need for the complicated back reference from the composer to the context as `hasPendingFrame` is maintained by the context.",
