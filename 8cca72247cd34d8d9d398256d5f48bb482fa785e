      "message": "That\u0027s interesting. Is it expected that the user will want to update a subset of the given libraries? Also, if the user does update a subset of the given libraries, then the command listed in the commit message might not encode all of the information about how to regenerate the given commit :(\n\nWould it work as well for your use case if instead of having a separate yes/no prompt per artifact, the script printed all libraries to update, printed a single yes/no prompt, and then continued?",

      "message": "Not really, that\u0027s effectively what the script does without this commit.  I\u0027ve found that in practice, it\u0027s better to be able to specify and confirm which libraries to update.\n\nI can update the commit message to include the list of libraries updated by this commit.  It would like something like ./update_library_versions.py --archives artifactId1 artifactId2",
