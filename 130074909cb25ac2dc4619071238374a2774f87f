      "message": "I\"m a bit confused here. Why are we calculating these borders based on items?  Why not have a simple method that iterates from 0 to spanCount (inclusive) and fills in `mCachedBorders`.We can call it from  updateMeasurements.\n\nAm I missing something ? \n\nAlso, you would not need `mSizePerSpanRemainder`. We can probably get rid of `mSizePerSpan` too.",
