      "message": "We need to keep this part. Using something deterministic instead of random was about what to use as a *subdomain* of this. The application package name may not be a valid hostname at all (this isn\u0027t really required by android afaik), and because it\u0027s typically reversed from a valid hostname in the usual case it won\u0027t be likely to have a real TLD which affects the way that certain network-related things work (due to the public suffix list).\n\nIf we\u0027re going to use the package name we\u0027ll need to do more validation of it: probably strip/replace invalid chars, check lengths of individual components, check lengths of the whole thing, etc, and then still use it as a subdomain of androidplatform.net.",
