      "message": "This should be removed. The class is designed wrong.\n\nLinearLayoutManager is a public type which implements ItemTouchHelper.ViewDropHandler which is a public type which has a public definition of this method. Putting @hide / @RestrictTo isn\u0027t doing anything.\n\nIf this type wanted to hide this method it should have implemented ItemTouchHelper.ViewDropHandler as an anonymous class stored in a field, not implemented on the type. But that would now be a breaking API change.",

If that\u0027s the intent (such as the only valid subtypes are part of the library), it should have had a package-private constructor. Adding that would be a breaking API change though. So... I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027m saying here other than the design of this class is problematic and we should probably write a lint check to prevent it in the future.",
