      "message": "I\u0027m not sure what the filepath for this script should be (the current name is kind of long); if anyone has suggestions, that\u0027d be great)\n\nI\u0027m also not sure what the name of this script should be, because it only does a first pass at diagnosing the build failure: classifying it into one of a few common problems. If for example, the build is failing at HEAD, it doesn\u0027t then try to analyze the error message and give some suggestions, or search through the git history either.\n\nI was thinking about calling this classify-build-failure.sh but that seems slightly too narrow in scope given that this script also can pinpoint which file in the out/ dir is triggering an incremental build failure.",
