      "message": "Oh it is interesting, as you see I have both this and separate visitors (see CheckUIVisitor). For this case I can\u0027t do separate visitors elegantly, because even if you\u0027re in finally block, you still need to check for  try + suspend call block in that finally, because it is subject of same rules. So if you want to have separate visitors you have to traverse same tree multiple times: \n1. traverse finally for view.** calls\n2. traverse finally for inner try-s\n3. traverse finally for suspend calls \n\nWorst thing that it isn\u0027t simply a constant, if you have try inside of try then you traverse even more (yeah you can optimise some of it, but it isn\u0027t very elegant)\n\nBut I don\u0027t have much experience of writing things like that, so if you have any patterns that you can advise, I\u0027m happy to follow them.",
