      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that I understand what you\u0027re saying in your second sentence. Currently, with a ViewPager inside a not-visible Fragment, the contents of that ViewPager cannot trust getUserVisibleHint() to be accurate. Is getUserVisibleHint only intended to mean visible relative to its parent Activity or Fragment, but not necessarily visible overall to the user?",

      "message": "I have a ViewPager with FragmentPagerAdapter. The second, offscreen (Fragment) item of that ViewPager, has itself a ViewPager, with another FragmentPagerAdapter. When the top-level ViewPager is initialized, and that second item is offscreen, and not visible, it initializes its ViewPager and sets the first item as visible, even though it is not. I\u0027m using a combination of getUserVisibleHint() and isResumed() to determine refreshing content when a user returns to a page. This results in the nested ViewPager\u0027s first item refreshing when it\u0027s not visible.",
