      "message": "This library adds FloatPropertyCompat class, so as a user I would expect the method to have a FloatPropertyCompat as a parameter when it called \"...ofProperyy\". With the current signature of setter and getter params I would suggest to not rename it and keep just \"flingAnimationOf\" as a name.",

      "message": "This feels like a misuse of FloatValueHolder class for me. I can think about quite more clear way of doing this with extracting an interface from FloatValueHolder and have two implementations: 1) which stores into a mValue field; 2) which takes setter and getter lambdas as a constructor parameter.",
