      "message": "I had a similar CL before, removing back button. At that time, sungsoo@ told me that it\u0027s better not to remove the string resources since there already exist translation resources and they are expensive, so I reverted (please see the diff between patch set 1 and 2 https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/support/+/870291/1..2)\n\nAlthough this CL didn\u0027t remove the translated strings (values-XX/strings.xml), I think the strings in values/strings.xml should also be untouched.",
